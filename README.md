#Personal Website

You can visit my main site at <http://davidvuong.ca>.

##Background
At a very young age, I wondered how the internet worked, and how we were able to load webpages on the computer. This led to my first experiment with HTML. Two years ago, after taking various computer science courses from high school and university, I began to experiment with JavaScript, jQuery, and CSS. 

I really wanted to design website from scratch without the use of Bootstrap or any web design tools for my own understanding. This led to my first creation: my own personal website, built from scratch, from bottom up.

If you have any suggestions, please feel free to contact me!
